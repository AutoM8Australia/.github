# AutoM8
AutoM8 is a cross-platform (Web, IOS, and Android) application designed to assist construction business in quote generation.

AutoM8 allows businesses to create quotes, templates for inspections, and employee accounts. These are stored securely in our database so that any employee with any device can access and complete inspections for their business.

The main benefit of AutoM8 is its template creation feature. This allows businesses to create customised inspections made from many different data fields, making the application useful for any company in the construction industry.

Our overarching goal is to streamline and standardise the process of quote generation within construction businesses. By minimising the time required from quote creation to completion, we aim to create value not just for the businesses but also for the end consumer.

## Inspector
Note the photos were taken on an iphone 13 with a notch, this explains the large gap above the title.
Also note the transparent gradient applied to the tabbar, this is a cool effect I added on top of react-native-good-navigation, it has the advantage of making scrollability clear.
